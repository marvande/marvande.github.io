I'm a student in Data Science with a background in Bioengineering passionate about big data and machine learning. 

On the side, I'm a student representative, the president of an association promoting gender equality and a proud owner of more than sixty house plants. I'm an avid gardener, so when I'm not working, you can usually find me with my hands in the dirt on my community garden plot or bothering my plants trying to rid them of pests.

A very rare flower of my Queen of the Night (Epiphyllum oxypetalum) that blooms only for one night :)
