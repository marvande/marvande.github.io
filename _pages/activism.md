Since my coming to the Swiss Institute of Technology in Lausanne, I have become extremely active in fighting for gender equality and equal rights. I'm the president of [Polyquity](https://polyquity.agepoly.ch/), a student association promoting gender equality on campus and a student representative. Throughout my [work](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/we-are-women-we-re-here-to-stay-and-we-matter/), I have raised awareness about discriminations minorities face at the EPFL and promoted other topics like sexual and menstrual health. Here are some of the projects I am most proud of.

## Paye Ton EPFL

[Paye Ton EPFL](https://www.instagram.com/payetonepfl/) is a campaign that debuted in July 2020 when we started collecting testimonies of discriminations students at the EPFL have to go through on a daily basis. These testimonies include stories of sexual harassment, sexual violence, ordinary sexism, transphobia, homophobia and racism. Overall, we have collected over 200 testimonies that were made public in December 2020. Since then, we have been working closely with the board of the EPFL and other organisations to improve the climate for minorities on campus and demanding rapid change.
